# pip-bash-completion
Bash tab completion for the `pip` CLI.

Requires the `pip-cache` python package to work, which is available on PyPi via

```
pip install pip-cache
```

Then simply copy the `pip` file somewhere where it will be sourced by
`bash_completion` (e.g. /etc/bash_completion.d/ on Debian Jessie).
